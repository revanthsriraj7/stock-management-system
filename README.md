# stock-management-system
This is the repository for the stock managment system made by the team supply chain saviours..

PROBLEM EXPLAINATION:--
 
Inadequate means of measurement and monitoring of goods and stock in industries, warehouses, 
retail stores etc. may result in delay in supply of goods and wastage of time, money, human resources, lost sales, 
dissatisfied customers, increase in shipment charges due to rush orders and might impact customer and supplier relationships.

Solution:--

an innovative, creative and a noble idea in form of an IOT based smart stock management 
system used to monitor the weight and quantity of the products and indicate low stock levels, 
there by enhancing inventory management and replenishment process.

â®š The machine displays the stock weight and quantity,then sends an email to the owner and the 
supplier notifying about the low stock. And also displays it in an android app for remote 
monitoring.

â®š This project provides a practical and a cost effective solution for monitoring and managing 
inventory levels in various settings such as industries, warehouses, retail stores, and homes. 
Thus, making it risk free and valuable asset in logistics.

â®š The widely used SMTP technology gives us an opportunity to send instant mails using google
